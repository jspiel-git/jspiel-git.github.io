      <h3>Weak Limits of Random Coefficient Autoregressive Processes and their Application in Ruin Theory</h3> 
      <p>
        (Scientific paper written with Yuchao Dong and published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668719304226">"Insurance: Mathematics and Economics"</a>, march 2020)
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper, we developed a new functional limit theorem similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donsker%27s_theorem">Donsker's theorem</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X79900151?via%3Dihub">Cox-Ross-Rubinstein approximation</a> which shows that Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes appear naturally in numerous problems in applied probability. The preprint version is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01828v2">on arXiv</a>.

      <h3>On the Ruin Problem with Investment when the Risky Asset is a Semimartingale</h3>
      <p>
        (Scientific paper written with Lioudmila Vostrikova and which will appear in "Theory of Probability and its Applications", 2020)
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper, we obtained new resuls concerning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruin_theory">stylized models of ruin</a> for insurance companiesinvesting in financial assets. The preprint version is available <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01825317v2">on HAL</a>.

      <h3>Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes in Ruin Theory</h3>
      <p>
        (PhD thesis, defended in december 2019)
      </p>
      <p>
        In my thesis, I studied Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in the context of applied probability and, in particular insurance mathematics. The presentation slides of the defense (PDF) are available <a href="contents/pres_spielmann.pdf">by following this link</a>. <!-- The thesis is available for download on theses -->

      <h3>Building a Minimalistic Ethereum Wallet in Python</h3>
      <p>
        (Series of blog posts and Python code, since march 2020)
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to develop a basic python framework and a tutorial to create a functional and secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> wallet. The first part has been published as <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-minimalistic-ethereum-wallet-in-python-part-1-rr4j32dp">a top story on hackernoon.com</a>.

      <h3>Techno Music Project</h3>
      <p>
        (Music and DJing project, since 2018)
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2018, I became interested in the creation and diffusion of techno music. Some of my mixes are available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vito_techno">on Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/vito49/">on Mixcloud</a>.
